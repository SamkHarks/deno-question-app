# wsd-project II

## Description of the app

This is a quiz app where you can answer questions created by other users. 
You can also create your own questions for other users.

This app is done following the guideline from the project-handout: https://wsd.cs.aalto.fi/26-course-project-ii/1-project-handout/

## Running the app

The app can be run online or locally

### Online location of the app
App can be tested at online from the following link: https://deno-questionapp.herokuapp.com/


### Running locally

#### First create database & database schemas 
For the project, use the following database schema:

CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  password CHAR(60)
);

CREATE TABLE questions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  title VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
  question_text TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE question_answer_options (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  question_id INTEGER REFERENCES questions(id),
  option_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_correct BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);

CREATE TABLE question_answers (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  question_id INTEGER REFERENCES questions(id),
  question_answer_option_id INTEGER REFERENCES question_answer_options(id),
  correct BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON users((lower(email)));

#### Configuration
Add your db configuration as usually straight to database/database.js 

### Running app
Run from root folder:
deno run --allow-all --unstable run-locally.js

## Testing app
deno test --allow-all --unstable

Two tests require some database information to work:
In the file located at .tests/routes/apis/questionApi_test.js 
the second test currently uses .send('{"questionId":"19", "optionId":"54"}')
You just need to set questionId & optionId to correct answer option from YOUR db so that this test works as expected.

In the file located at ./tests/routes/controllers/loginController_test.js
The first test expects that email = test@mail.com and password = test can be found from db.

Second test expects that email = null@mail.com and password = null cannot be found from db.
